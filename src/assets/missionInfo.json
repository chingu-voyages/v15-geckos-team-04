        Studying Mars ' interior structure answers key questions about the early
        formation of rocky planets in our inner solar system - Mercury,
        Venus,
        Earth,
        and Mars - more than 4 billion years ago,
        as well as rocky
        exoplanets. <

        The lander uses cutting edge instruments,
        to delve deep beneath the surface
        and seek the fingerprints of the processes that formed the terrestrial
        planets.It does so by measuring the planet 's "vital signs": its "pulse"
        (seismology),
        "temperature"(heat flow),
        and "reflexes"(precision tracking). <

        This mission is part of NASA 's Discovery Program for highly focused science
